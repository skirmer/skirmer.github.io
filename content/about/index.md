My professional career has been driven by continuous learning. My approach to any technical problem is "I can probably learn how to do that" followed by rolling up my sleeves to get things done. I learned to be a data scientist through hard work outside the traditional classroom, including a significant amount of on-the-job learning with the help of many incredibly talented colleagues. I highly value helping others following similar autodidactic paths, and I spend time advising and encouraging other data scientists or aspiring data scientists from nontraditional backgrounds and/or underrepresented groups.
