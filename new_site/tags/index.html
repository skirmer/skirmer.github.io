      Businesses are jumping on a bandwagon of creating something, anything that they can launch as a “Generative AI” feature or product. What’s driving this, and why is it a problem?
The AI Hype Cycle: In a Race to Somewhere?
I was recently catching up on back issues of Money Stuff, Matt Levine’s indispensable newsletter/blog at Bloomberg, and there was an interesting piece about how AI stock picking algorithms don’t actually favor AI stocks (and also they don’t perform all that well on the picks they do make).

      I sometimes mention in my written work and speeches that I have a sociology background, and used to be an adjunct professor of sociology at DePaul University before embarking on my data science career. I loved sociology, and still do — it shaped so much about how I understand the world and my own place in it.
However, when I made a career change and turned to data science, I spent a lot of time explaining how that background, training, and experience were assets to my practice of data science, because it wasn’t obvious to people.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Do our definitions of “mistake” make sense when it comes to ML/AI? If not, why not?
A comment on my recent post about the public perception of machine learning got me thinking about the meaning of error in machine learning. The reader asked if I thought machine learning models would always “make mistakes”. As I described in that post, people have a strong tendency to anthropomorphize machine learning models. When we interact with an LLM chatbot, we apply techniques to those engagements that we have learned by communicating with other people—persuasion, phrasing, argument, etc.

      Learning how to be a professional data scientist is different now, but it’s not impossible
Today’s column is partly about data science, but it’s also about the sociology of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed. I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist, were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways that made it possible for me to get where I am.

We don’t talk enough about how much manual, human work we rely upon to make the exciting advances in ML possible. The truth is, the division between technology and human activity is artificial. All the inputs that make models are the result of human effort, and all the outputs in one way or another exist to have an impact on people.

      Learning how to be a professional data scientist is different now, but it’s not impossible
Today’s column is partly about data science, but it’s also about the sociology of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed. I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist, were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways that made it possible for me to get where I am.

      I sometimes mention in my written work and speeches that I have a sociology background, and used to be an adjunct professor of sociology at DePaul University before embarking on my data science career. I loved sociology, and still do — it shaped so much about how I understand the world and my own place in it.
However, when I made a career change and turned to data science, I spent a lot of time explaining how that background, training, and experience were assets to my practice of data science, because it wasn’t obvious to people.

      Learning how to be a professional data scientist is different now, but it’s not impossible
Today’s column is partly about data science, but it’s also about the sociology of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed. I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist, were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways that made it possible for me to get where I am.

      Learning how to be a professional data scientist is different now, but it’s not impossible
Today’s column is partly about data science, but it’s also about the sociology of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed. I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist, were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways that made it possible for me to get where I am.

      Why machine learning literacy for the public needs to be a priority for data science, and what we can do about it.
I was listening to a podcast recently with an assortment of intelligent, thoughtful laypeople (whose names I will not share, to be polite) talking about how AI can be used in healthcare. I had misgivings already, because they were using the term “AI”, which I find frequently means everything and nothing at the same time.

      I sometimes mention in my written work and speeches that I have a sociology background, and used to be an adjunct professor of sociology at DePaul University before embarking on my data science career. I loved sociology, and still do — it shaped so much about how I understand the world and my own place in it.
However, when I made a career change and turned to data science, I spent a lot of time explaining how that background, training, and experience were assets to my practice of data science, because it wasn’t obvious to people.
