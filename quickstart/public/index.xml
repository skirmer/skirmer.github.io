      <description>My professional career has been driven by continuous learning. My approach to any technical problem is &amp;ldquo;I can probably learn how to do that&amp;rdquo; followed by rolling up my sleeves to get things done. I learned to be a data scientist through hard work outside the traditional classroom, including a significant amount of on-the-job learning with the help of many incredibly talented colleagues. I highly value helping others following similar autodidactic paths, and I spend time advising and encouraging other data scientists or aspiring data scientists from nontraditional backgrounds and/or underrepresented groups.</description>

      <description>Learning how to be a professional data scientist is different now, but it’s not impossible
Today’s column is partly about data science, but it’s also about the sociology of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed. I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist, were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways that made it possible for me to get where I am.</description>

      <description>Much of the division between technology and human activity is artificial — how do people make our work possible?
We don’t talk enough about how much manual, human work we rely upon to make the exciting advances in ML possible. The truth is, the division between technology and human activity is artificial. All the inputs that make models are the result of human effort, and all the outputs in one way or another exist to have an impact on people.</description>

      <description>Businesses are jumping on a bandwagon of creating something, anything that they can launch as a “Generative AI” feature or product. What’s driving this, and why is it a problem?
The AI Hype Cycle: In a Race to Somewhere?
I was recently catching up on back issues of Money Stuff, Matt Levine’s indispensable newsletter/blog at Bloomberg, and there was an interesting piece about how AI stock picking algorithms don’t actually favor AI stocks (and also they don’t perform all that well on the picks they do make).</description>

The title is a trick question, of course. Much like Data Scientist before it, the title Machine Learning Engineer is developing into a trend in the job market for people in our profession, but there is no consensus about the meaning of the title or the functions and skills it should encompass.</description>

      <description>Why machine learning literacy for the public needs to be a priority for data science, and what we can do about it.
I was listening to a podcast recently with an assortment of intelligent, thoughtful laypeople (whose names I will not share, to be polite) talking about how AI can be used in healthcare. I had misgivings already, because they were using the term “AI”, which I find frequently means everything and nothing at the same time.</description>

Implementation
In part 1, we talked about applying a data science mindset to the problem of location accuracy. But how do we actually carry out this process? We used python and a combination of several tools (see table below) to make this idea a reality. The first thing we needed was a clustering technique.</description>

When we interact with an LLM chatbot, we apply techniques to those engagements that we have learned by communicating with other people—persuasion, phrasing, argument, etc.</description>
